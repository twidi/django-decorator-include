Usage
-----

``decorator_include`` is intended for use in URL confs as a replacement
for the ``django.conf.urls.include`` function. It works in almost
the same way as ``include``, however the first argument should be either a
decorator or an iterable of decorators to apply, in reverse order, to all
included views. Here is an example URL conf::

    from django.conf.urls import url
    from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

    from decorator_include import decorator_include

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^$', 'mysite.views.index', name='index'),
        url(r'^secret/', decorator_include(login_required, 'mysite.secret.urls'),
    ]
