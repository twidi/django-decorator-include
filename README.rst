Requirements
------------

The only required package is ``future``, used for compatibility with python 2 and python 3

Usage
-----

``decorator_include`` is intended for use in URL confs as a replacement
for the ``django.conf.urls.include`` function. It works in almost
the same way as ``include``, however the first argument should be either a
decorator or an iterable of decorators to apply, in reverse order, to all
included views. Here is an example URL conf::

    from django.conf.urls import url
    from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

    from decorator_include import decorator_include

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^$', 'mysite.views.index', name='index'),
        url(r'^secret/', decorator_include(login_required, 'mysite.secret.urls'),
    ]

Running tests
-------------

If `decorator_include` is in the `INSTALLED_APPS` of your project, simply run::

    django-admin test decorator_include

(you may want to use ``django-admin`` or  ``./manage.py`` depending on your installation)

If you are in a fresh virtualenv to work on ``decorator_include``, install the django version you want::

    pip install django

Then make the ``decorator_include`` module available in your python path. For example, with ``virtualenv-wrapper``, considering you are at the root of the ``django-decorator-include`` repository, simply do::

    add2virtualenv src

Or simply::

    pip install -e .

Then to run the tests, this library provides a test project, so you can launch them this way::

    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=decorator_include.tests.testproject.settings django-admin.py test decorator_include

Or simply launch the ``runtests.sh`` script (it will run this exact command)::

    ./runtests.sh
